        - Briefly summarize the differences between the reference image and the code, summarize them into a few categories of changes you want to make. Base your later generation of categorizedChanges based on these categories.
        - only use tailwind, react, and react icons. Follow the current code structure, do not include any import or export statements, just use a simple component definition () => {};
        - when adding icons, pick from this list of lucide react icons, do not use others: LuActivity, LuAirplay, LuAlertCircle, LuAlignCenter, LuAlignJustify, LuAlignLeft, LuAlignRight, LuAnchor, LuAperture, LuArchive, LuArrowDown, LuArrowLeft, LuArrowRight, LuArrowUp, LuAtSign, LuAward, LuBarChart, LuBattery, LuBell, LuBluetooth, LuBook, LuBookmark, LuBox, LuBriefcase, LuCalendar, LuCamera, LuCheck, LuCheckCircle, LuChevronDown, LuChevronLeft, LuChevronRight, LuChevronUp, LuClipboard, LuClock, LuCloud, LuCode, LuCompass, LuCopy, LuCreditCard, LuCrop
        - there are a few stock photos for use under the folder /stock/, they are named after their orientation, like landscape0.jpg, landscape1.jpg, portrait0.jpg, etc. There are landscape images with index 0 to 9, and portrait 0 to 7. For example, you can use         <img src="/stock/portait0.jpg" alt="Example Image" />.

Pay attention to ${blendMode.filter(mode => mode !== "Customize").join(" ")}. Base your later generation of categorizedChanges based on these categories.
        - Never directly pulls content from the reference to update the source code. For blending color and layout, preserve all original content in the UI for source code, only change/add the original content when it's really necessary for following a layout. When you blend in the addition mode, generate content based on the context of the source code.
        - Do not use list and .map functions to represent lists. Just generate HTML elements for each of the list items.
