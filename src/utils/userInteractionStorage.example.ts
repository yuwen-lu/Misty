// Example: How user interactions would be stored and compiled

// Example 1: User selects fonts
console.log('=== Font Selection Example ===');
saveFontSelection('Sans Serif', 'Inter', 'Inter', 'Modern & Professional', 'Clean, readable, perfect for tech and business');
saveFontSelection('Serif', 'Playfair Display', 'Playfair Display', 'Elegant & Luxurious', 'High contrast, perfect for fashion/luxury');

// Example 2: User intent (would be stored via LLM tool)
console.log('=== User Intent Example ===');

  projectType: 'blog website',
  audience: 'casual readers, students',
  topic: 'creative arts',
  style: 'modern'
});

// Example 3: User provides design feedback on websites
console.log('=== Design Notes Example ===');
addDesignNote('apple.com', 'Love the clean minimalist design and perfect use of whitespace. The typography hierarchy is excellent but navigation could be more prominent.');
addDesignNote('apple.com', 'Great use of product imagery but they could be larger for better impact');
addDesignNote('airbnb.com', 'Beautiful photography and warm color palette creates great mood, but some sections have too much visual clutter');

// Example 4: Compile context for AI design generation
console.log('=== Compiled Context for Design Generation ===');
const designContext = compileUserInteractionContext();
console.log(designContext);

// Example 5: Get interaction statistics
console.log('=== User Interaction Statistics ===');
